Shace Event API
=====================================

- Install Play 2.2.x
- Install Postgresql
- Create a database called "shace"
- By default the API is configured to connect with default postgresql user and adress, you can change configuration in file conf/application.conf (don't even try to commit it)
- To launch the application in debug mode, go into main folder and type "play debug run"
- You can access and debug the API on "http://localhost:9000/events" for example

To configure an Eclipse project, type "play eclipsify". Then import the main directory into Eclipse with "import project"

Tests are not yet available.
